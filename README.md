# Blog_website_demo_upgrad_assignment
This project is about the blog website without database
Here Sign-In/Up functionality is added
A segment name All Posts in which user can visit the all posts.
A segment Create Posts is added in which user can add new post.
A Edit and Save button is added so the user can modified the existing post.
A comment box is given in which user can provide his/her desire comment.
# But As I mentioned this is without database so the above functionality will remain there untill you refresh the page .
After refreshing it's original data is stored as provided by me.
